# Macroalgae BEF project
Repository for the macroalgae transplant and experiment and field surveys planned for the 2021 field season at Tjarno marine station.

> Data availability

All data are hosted on RESEARCHBOX and can be downloaded directly from this link:

+ https://researchbox.org/435&PEER_REVIEW_passcode=ECOTGX

> Logger data analysis

To process the raw temperature and light intensity data from the hobo loggers, go to the RESEARCHBOX repository (link above). Then, select and download all 20 files from the raw_logger_data category. Create a folder in your working directory called tile_logger_data and save the 20 files into this folder. Note that very limited processing of these data was done before uploading the files to research box using the clean_tile_experiment_logger_data.R script.

Download the script from the RESEARCHBOX repository called: process_tile_experiment_logger_data.R.
